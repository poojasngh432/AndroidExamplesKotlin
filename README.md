## BASICS
* [Statically typed language](https://android.jlelse.eu/magic-lies-here-statically-typed-vs-dynamically-typed-languages-d151c7f95e2b) - Statically typed means that the variables used in the program must explicitly be declared along with their types (data type). For example, C, Java, Kotlin and many more are statically typed. Consider the below C programming code for statically typed programming.   
  int num;    // Explicitly declaring the type of the variable   
  num = 10;    
  print(num);     
  ***The inverse of the statically typed is dynamic typing, here you donâ€™t have to explicitly specify the type of the data. One of the best dynamically typed programming language is python. Consider the following python code below:***
> Python Code    
num = 10   // No explicit declaration    
print(num)

* [null-safe](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kotlin-null-safety/) 
* [Cross-platform](https://blog.mindorks.com/getting-started-with-kotlin-multi-platform) - It means that the system or the product can work across multiple platforms or operating system environments. For example Microsoft Excel, Word, Powerpoint works on both Windows and Macintosh Operating systems.     
* [Extension Functions](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kotlin-extension-function/) -   Kotlin gives the programmer the ability to add more functionality to the existing classes, by without inheriting them. This is achieved through a feature known as extensions. When a function is added to an existing class it is known as Extension Function.       
To add an extension function to a class, define a new function appended to the classname
* [High order function](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/kotlin-higher-order-functions/) -   
* [Data class](https://www.programiz.com/kotlin-programming/data-class) -      
* [Interoperable] -
